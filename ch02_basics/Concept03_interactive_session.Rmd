# Interactive session

Interactive sessions are another way to use a session. Go ahead and define one:

```{r}
library(tensorflow)
sess <- tf$InteractiveSession()
```

We have a matrix we want to invert:
```{r}
x <- tf$constant(matrix(c(1.0, 2.0), nrow=1, byrow=T))
neg_op <- tf$negative(x)
```

Since we're using an interactive session, we can just call the eval() method on the op.
```{r}
result <- neg_op$eval()

print(result)
```


That code's a little cleaner when using Jupyter notebooks (like this one).

Don't forget to close the session:

```{r}
sess$close()
```
