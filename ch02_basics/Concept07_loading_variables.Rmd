# Loading variables


Concept 06 was about saving variables. This one's about loading what you saved. Start by creating an interactive session:

```{r}
library(tensorflow)
sess <- tf$InteractiveSession()
```

Create a boolean vector called spikes of the same dimensions as before:

```{r}
spikes <- tf$Variable(rep(FALSE,8), name='spikes')
```


Restored the variable data from disk, serve warm, and enjoy:

```{r}
saver <- tf$train$Saver()

res <- tryCatch({
    saver$restore(sess, save_path = './spikes.ckpt')
    print(spikes$eval())
},error = function(e) {
  print('file not found')
})
```



file not found

Show's over, goodnight:

```{r}
sess$close()
```
