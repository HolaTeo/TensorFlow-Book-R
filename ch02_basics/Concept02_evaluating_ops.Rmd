# Evaluating ops


Import TensorFlow:

```{r}
library(tensorflow)
```


Start with a 1x2 matrix:
```{r}
x <- tf$constant(matrix(c(1, 2), nrow=1))
```


Let's negate it. Define the negation op to be run on the matrix:
```{r}
neg_x <- tf$negative(x)
```

It's nothing special if you print it out. In fact, it doesn't even perform the negation computation. Check out what happens when you simply print it:
```{r}
print(neg_x)
```
You need to summon a session so you can launch the negation op:
```{r}
with(tf$Session() %as% sess, {
    result <- sess$run(neg_x)
    print(result)
})
```
